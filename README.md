## Introduction
The goal of our final project is to study the wage difference between Black and White People and the reason behind it.

The data is roughly about 25,000 records of people between the ages of 18 and 70, and the data are taken many decades ago so the wages are lower compared to current times.

This is how our dataset looks like:

We were required to find some insights and bring them to the table with this dataset, especially, we were asked to utilize some nonparametric methods learnt in the class.
